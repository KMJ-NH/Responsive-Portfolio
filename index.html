      <img src="assets/images/butterfly.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="butterfly picture">

      <p>I'm enrolled in the University of New Hampshire's coding Boot Camp with a plan to become a web devloper. I have a background
        working with data in various ways, and working as a SAS programmer to pull raw data files, manipulate the data, and
        then populate SQL tables with my manipulated data to be used in report generation.</p>

      <p>In my earlier professional life I used my degree in psychology to work with chronically mentally ill adults in the
        community, and I developed and carried out behavior modification techniques with physically agressive brain-injured
        adults within a rehabilitation center environment. While working in the rehab center, I also worked as a research
        assistant to a behavioral neurologist by pulling data from medical charts for a medication study he was doing.</p>
